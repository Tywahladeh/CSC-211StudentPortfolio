The RDRP sets forth the terms under which any allegation that a domain name is not used primarily for business or commercial purposes shall be enforced on a case-by-case, fact specific basis by an independent ICANN-accredited dispute provider. None of the violations of the Restrictions will be enforced directly by or through Registry Operator or MarkMonitor.

MarkMonitor provides a web-based interface for Customer to manage their DNS settings and a distributed DNS infrastructure. Customer understands and agrees that MarkMonitor’s DNS Services include the following:<ol class><li class>Real Time Propagation – Changes and updates to DNS records fully propagate in within minutes;</li><li class>Quick Record Adding – Allows customer to add single records;</li><li class>Bulk Record Adding – Allows customer to add many records at one time;</li><li class>Dynamic Import of Existing DNS Records – Zone import feature transfers customer’s complete set of existing DNS records including reverse DNS to MarkMonitor DNS;</li><li class>Full Access Record Editing – The ability to edit A Records, CNAME Records, MX Records, and PTR Records;</li><li class>Alias Setup – Point domains to a specific site to avoid a ‘site not found’ error message.;</li><li class>Whole Zone or Individual Record TTL Editing – Edit the “Time To Live” within zones or individual records by hand;</li><li class>Active/Inactive Record Status – Allows customer to take a sub-domain or alias off-line temporarily without removing it from the control panel;</li><li class>Syntax Checking – Checks for common mistakes to prevent miss-configuration of entered information;</li><li class>DNS Lockdown – Prevents accidental zone changes as lockdown can be done at the record, zone. or global level;</li><li class>DZRC – Dynamic Zone and Record Creation for auto-creation of zones and records upon registration;</li><li class>Scheduling – Schedule DNS records to activate, deactivate or change to another record type at a predefined time.</li></ol></li><li class>DNS Procedures In order for MarkMonitor to provide DNS service, Customer must first populate the MarkMonitor DNS interface either manually by entering their DNS zones and DNS records or automatically by allowing the MarkMonitor DNS interface to import the zone and record data directly from the Customer’s existing name server. After population, Customer may choose to test the DNS settings prior to changing name server records associated with the domains at the various Registries. In order for MarkMonitor DNS to be authoritative for the domains, Customer must modify the domains to reflect the MarkMonitor DNS name servers (unless the Hidden Master feature is selected). However if Customer chooses to transfer such domains to MarkMonitor using the Registrar Transfer Service, MarkMonitor will modify the name servers for the domains at no additional charge. Even after MarkMonitor DNS becomes authoritative for the domains, it is recommended that the Customer not delete or deactivate its former DNS settings because caching and propagation delays may result in some DNS queries still directed to the old name servers for a period of time.</li><li class>Usage Parameters Customer agrees that the usage parameters of the DNS Services specified by MarkMonitor, including those set forth in your Order, under this Agreement or otherwise, will not be exceeded. MarkMonitor reserves the right to monitor Customer’s usage parameters, including but not limited to the number of domains, number of DNS host records and number of DNS queries (“Service Usage”). Based on Customer’s actual Service Usage as solely determined and measured by MarkMonitor in each one-month period during the term of this Agreement, MarkMonitor reserves the right to bill Customer in arrears for the DNS Services rendered above the allowed limits identified in the service package, including additional usage not paid for in advance. Usage above Customer’s service package subscription levels will be billed in accordance with the MarkMonitor’ standard fees, or as otherwise set forth in Customer’s written agreement with MarkMonitor. You represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights to use DNS Services to forward, point, alias, or resolve your domain name(s) or email to the other domain name or email address designated by you in ordering such services.</li><li class>Fees Customer agrees to pay MarkMonitor the Fees applicable to any DNS Services ordered hereunder.</li><li class>Limitation of Liability CUSTOMER RECOGNIZES THAT THE INTERNET CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE PARTICIPATING NETWORKS WHICH ARE SEPARATELY OWNED AND THEREFORE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF MarkMonitor.

The following violations are grounds for immediate suspension of service and will result in termination of accounts and/or Agreements if MarkMonitor determines, in its sole discretion, that Customer has in any way originated or are responsible for the following: (i) posting articles or substantially similar articles to an excessive number of newsgroups using a MarkMonitor hosted domain, or posting such messages through a MarkMonitor DNS Service; and (ii) sending unsolicited e-mailings, whether or not such activities provoke complaints.
